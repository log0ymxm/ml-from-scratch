Implementations for a few popular machine learning models. Made in python with an interface similar to sklearn. Just an exercise, not at all recommended for production.

Models:
- AdaBoost
- DecisionTree
- NaiveBayes
- NearestNeighbors
- Random
- RandomForest
- Rule Based
- Linear models: Lasso, Ridge, Poisson, Perceptron, SVM, Linear w/ least squares, Linear w/ gradient descent, Linear w/ stochastic gd, Logistic
- Wrappers for keras & xgboost

Some code also for experimenting easily with an array of datasets and hyperparams
